# Kotlin Basics

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to Kotlin, a modern, concise, and powerful programming language for the JVM.

## What is Kotlin?

Kotlin is a statically-typed programming language developed by JetBrains. It runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and can also be compiled to JavaScript or native code. Kotlin is known for its:

- **Concise Syntax:** Less code to write and read, fewer opportunities for errors.
- **Modern Features:** Lambdas, coroutines, higher-order functions for cleaner and more expressive code.
- **Null Safety:** Helps prevent NullPointerExceptions, a common source of bugs in Java.
- **Interoperability with Java:** Seamlessly integrate Kotlin code with existing Java projects.

## Key Concepts

This repository will cover the following core Kotlin concepts:
- **Variables:**
  - `val` for immutable variables.
  - `var` for mutable variables.
- **Control Flow Statements:**
    - `if` and `when` for conditional execution.
    - `for` and `while` for loops.
- **Null Safety:**
    - Safe calls (`?.`)
    - Elvis operator (`?:`)
    - Non-null assertions (`!!`)
- **Classes and Objects:**
    - Defining classes and creating instances.
    - Constructors, properties, and methods.
- **Inheritance:**
    - Extending classes and overriding methods.
- **Interfaces:**
    - Defining contracts and implementing them.
- **Exception Handling:**
    - `try`, `catch`, and `finally` blocks.
